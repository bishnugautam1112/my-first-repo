### **Q.1. a) Principles of Management & Relevancy in Tech**
**Simple Answer:**
Management principles are basic rules (by Henri Fayol) to run a company smoothly. In a Tech environment, they are applied like this:
1.  **Division of Work:** Don't let one person do everything. Split work: Designers design, Coders code, Testers test.
2.  **Authority & Responsibility:** Give engineers the power to choose their tools (Authority) but make them answerable for the deadline (Responsibility).
3.  **Order:** Keep code and files organized (using Github/Cloud) so work doesn't get lost.
4.  **Esprit de Corps:** Build team spirit. Tech teams must work together to fix bugs.

> **Neplish Concept:** "Kaam baadne (Division), Power dine (Authority), ra Team ma milera kaam garne. Tech ma yestai huncha—Frontend ra Backend chuttyaune, ani milera App banaune."

### **Q.1. b) Roles & Responsibilities of Engineering Manager**
**Simple Answer:**
An Engineering Manager is a bridge between the **Tech Team** (Developers) and the **Business Goals** (CEO/Client).
**Roles:**
*   **Leader:** Motivates the team.
*   **Communicator:** Translates "nerd talk" to business language.
*   **Decision Maker:** Decides which technology to use.
**Responsibilities:**
1.  **Project Delivery:** Ensuring the software is finished on time.
2.  **Hiring & Training:** Finding good engineers and teaching them.
3.  **Technical Decisions:** Choosing the right coding language or tools.

> **Neplish Concept:** "Technical Boss ho. Aafai code nalekhne, tara team lai guide garne, manche hire garne, ra deadline bhitra project sakne jimma line."

### **Q.2. a) Levels of Planning (Strategic, Tactical, Operational)**
**Simple Answer:**
Planning happens at 3 levels, like a pyramid:
1.  **Strategic (Top Level):** Long-term vision (5+ years). Done by CEO. *Example: "We want to be the No.1 AI company."*
2.  **Tactical (Middle Level):** Medium-term (1-2 years). Done by Department Managers. *Example: "Hire 50 AI engineers this year."*
3.  **Operational (Lower Level):** Daily/Weekly tasks. Done by Team Leads. *Example: "Finish the login page code by Friday."*

> **Neplish Concept:**
> *   **Strategic:** Thulo Sapana (CEO).
> *   **Tactical:** Department ko Plan (Manager).
> *   **Operational:** Aaja-bholi ko kaam (Staff).

### **Q.2. b) Emerging Planning & Organizing Issues in ICT**
**Simple Answer:**
IT companies face special problems today:
1.  **Fast Change:** Technology changes every 6 months. Long plans fail.
2.  **Remote Work:** Employees are everywhere (Home/Office). Hard to organize.
3.  **Talent War:** Good engineers leave quickly for higher salary.
**Solutions:**
*   **Be Agile:** Make short plans (2 weeks), not long plans (5 years).
*   **Use Tools:** Use Slack/Zoom to connect remote teams.
*   **Flexible Structure:** Don't have too many bosses; let teams decide fast.

> **Neplish Concept:** "Tech chito purano huncha, tei bhayera lamo plan nabaunne. Staff ghar bata kaam garchan, tei bhayera Zoom/Jira use garera organize garne."

### **Q.3. a) Challenges in Managing Technical Workforce**
**Simple Answer:**
Managing engineers is hard because:
1.  **Skill Obsolescence:** Their skills get outdated fast.
2.  **Burnout:** They work long hours/late nights leading to stress.
3.  **High Demand:** Other companies try to steal them.
**Solutions:**
1.  **Training:** Pay for their new courses.
2.  **Flexible Time:** Let them work from home or flexible hours.
3.  **Clear Career Path:** Show them how they can get promoted.

> **Neplish Concept:** "Engineer ko padhai purano huna nadine (Training), dherai pelera bihana-rati kaam nagaraune (No Burnout), ra khusi rakhne natra bhagchan."

### **Q.3. b) Maslow vs. Herzberg (Motivation)**
**Simple Answer:**
*   **Maslow (Pyramid):** Says needs are in steps. You must satisfy basic needs (Food/Salary) before you want Respect or Growth.
*   **Herzberg (Two Factors):**
    *   **Hygiene Factors:** Things that stop you from complaining (Salary, AC). *Being okay.*
    *   **Motivators:** Things that make you work harder (Achievement, Promotion). *Being excited.*
**Contrast:** Maslow says money motivates at the bottom level. Herzberg says money just prevents anger; only achievement motivates.

> **Neplish Concept:**
> *   **Maslow:** Bharyang (Ladder). Tala ko step pura nabhai mathi jadaina.
> *   **Herzberg:** Dui kura. **Hygiene** (Salary) le dukha hataucha, **Motivator** (Award) le josh badhaucha.

### **Q.5. a) Performance Appraisal & Methods**
**Simple Answer:**
**Appraisal** is evaluating an employee's work at the end of the year.

3.  **Rating Scale:** Boss gives marks (1 to 5) for skills like teamwork, punctuality, etc.
4.  **Continuous Feedback:** Discussing performance every week instead of once a year.

> **Neplish Concept:** "School ko Report Card jastai ho.
> *   **MBO:** Target pura bhayo ki nai?
> *   **Self:** Aafai le aafu lai number dine.
> *   **Rating:** Boss le number dine."

### **Q.5. b) ICT Tools for Control & Efficiency**

**Examples:**
*   **Jira:** For tracking software bugs.
*   **MS Project:** For scheduling timelines.
*   **Slack:** For talking to the team.

> **Neplish Concept:** "Register ma lekhnu pardaina. **Jira** ma task herne, **Slack** ma guff garne. Kaam chito (Efficient) ra mistake bina (Control) huncha."

**Simple Answer:**
How to solve fights in a team:
1.  **Collaborating (Win-Win):** Find a solution where both are happy. (Best way).
