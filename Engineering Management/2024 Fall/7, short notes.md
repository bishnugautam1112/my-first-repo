### **Option 7. a) Virtual Organization**

**Answer for Exam (5 Marks):**

**Definition:**
A **Virtual Organization (VO)** is a network of independent firms, teams, or individuals that are geographically dispersed but collaborate using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to appear as a single unified organization. Unlike traditional organizations, they often lack a physical headquarters and rely on the internet to coordinate work.

**Key Characteristics:**
1.  **Technology-Driven:** Heavy reliance on digital tools (Zoom, Slack, Cloud computing) for communication and collaboration.
2.  **Boundaryless:** There are no strict physical boundaries; employees can work from anywhere in the world.
3.  **Flexibility:** Teams can be formed and dissolved quickly based on project needs (Dynamic structure).
4.  **Outsourcing:** Focuses on core competencies while outsourcing other functions to external partners.

**Benefits:**
*   **Cost Efficiency:** Saves money on office rent, utilities, and infrastructure.
*   **Access to Global Talent:** Can hire the best experts regardless of their location.
*   **24/7 Productivity:** Teams in different time zones allow work to continue around the clock.

**Example:**
A software company where the CEO is in the USA, developers are in Nepal, and designers are in Europe, all working together via GitHub and Slack.

### **Option 7. b) Importance of Planning**

**Answer for Exam (5 Marks):**

**Definition:**
Planning is the primary function of management that involves setting objectives and determining the best course of action to achieve them. It bridges the gap between where we are and where we want to go.

**Importance of Planning:**
1.  **Provides Direction:** Planning clearly defines goals (what to do) and strategies (how to do it). This ensures all departments and employees move in the same direction.
2.  **Reduces Uncertainty and Risk:** By forecasting future trends and preparing for potential challenges (contingency planning), managers can minimize the impact of sudden market changes.
3.  **Facilitates Decision Making:** It provides a clear framework and criteria for making decisions. Managers can evaluate alternatives based on whether they align with the plan.
4.  **Promotes Efficiency:** Planning coordinates activities and resources, reducing overlapping work and wasteful activities.
5.  **Encourages Innovation:** Good planning encourages managers to think creatively about new ways to achieve goals, fostering a culture of innovation.

### **Option 7. c) Expectancy Theory**

**Answer for Exam (5 Marks):**

**Introduction:**
Proposed by **Victor Vroom**, the Expectancy Theory of motivation states that an individual tends to act in a certain way based on the expectation that the act will be followed by a given outcome and on the attractiveness of that outcome to the individual.

**The Formula:**
$$Motivation = Expectancy (E) \times Instrumentality (I) \times Valence (V)$$

**Three Key Components:**
1.  **Expectancy (Effort $\to$ Performance):**
    *   The belief that "If I try hard, I can do this job."
    *   *Example:* Can I actually write this code if I try?
2.  **Instrumentality (Performance $\to$ Reward):**
    *   The belief that "If I perform well, I will get a reward."
    *   *Example:* If I finish the code, will the boss actually give me a bonus?
3.  **Valence (Value of Reward):**
    *   The value the individual places on the reward.
    *   *Example:* Do I actually want the bonus? (If the reward is something I don't care about, motivation is zero).

**Conclusion:**
According to this theory, for motivation to be high, all three factors must be high. If even one is zero (e.g., I don't believe I'll get the reward), motivation drops to zero.
